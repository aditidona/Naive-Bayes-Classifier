## Naive-Bayes-Classifier
-This is my whole learning on Naive-Bayes-Classifier.
## Learning
- Build Naive Bayes from scratch.
## Project - Text Classification
  - Built the Feature Matrix from the raw text using Term-Frequency representation.
  - Build a Na√Øve Bayes Classifier from scratch and compared the result with the inbuilt classifier.
  - Accuracy Achieved :
    - Score of inbuilt sklearn model on test data:  0.8612
    - Score of Self implemented model on test data:  0.8602
